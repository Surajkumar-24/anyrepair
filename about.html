  <h2>About AnyRepair</h2>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      AnyRepair was founded by <strong>Krishna and Suraj</strong> to solve a
      simple but widespread problem — laptop repairs in India are often
      opaque, inconvenient, and unreliable.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      Customers are frequently left guessing about actual issues,
      fair pricing, and repair quality. We set out to change that by
      building a service focused on honest diagnostics, clear communication,
      and professional delivery.

  <h2>What We Do</h2>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      We provide doorstep laptop diagnosis and repair services, allowing
      customers to get their laptops checked and repaired at home.
      Our technicians identify the problem at the customer’s location,
      explain the issue clearly, and share a transparent price quote
      before any repair work begins.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      Repairs are carried out only after customer approval.
